# RS3-Shortcuts
AutoHotkey script that adds some ease of use rebindings for RuneScape 3.
The script does not double-bind anything, it simply rebinds keys 1 to 1 to make them easier to access.

# While RuneScape is active
XButton1 (MouseButton4, one of the side buttons on a mouse) => Space (for crafting or otherwise accepting things)
XButton2 (MouseButton5, one of the side buttons on a mouse) => 1 (loading bank presets, selecting first option in dialogue)
Joy1 (varies depending on controller; also generally unused and untested by me due to AutoHotkey reasons) => Click

# While RuneScape is active and NumLock is activated
Space => Click (it's easier for me to hit space with a stationary mouse to refresh an action than it is to reach to my mouse)
MButton (Mouse wheel click) => 2 (i had to keep selecting which type of clay crafting to do at a portable crafter, so i added this so both options are available on the mouse)
NumpadEnter (enter on the numpad) => lock and unlock mouse position

# At all times
NumpadEnter (enter on the numpad) => unlock mouse position (that way you don't ever get it irrecoverably stuck)
